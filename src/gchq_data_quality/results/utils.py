"""This module provides utility functions for result aggregation and manipulation
within the data quality framework. It is intended for internal use by data quality
rule and configuration classes (e.g., Rule.evaluate(df), DataQualityConfig.execute(df)).

Functions in this module are designed to operate independently of Pydantic models or
explicit schema knowledge, to avoid circular import dependencies.


Note:
    End users should not call these functions directly. They are integrated into
    the models and configuration classes that orchestrate data quality evaluation.
