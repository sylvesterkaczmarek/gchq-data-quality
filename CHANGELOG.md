## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Fixed

- Preserve nested failed-record samples during JSON export and normalize missing
  scalar values without mutating the stored samples. (#44)

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where optional `None`-able fields in `DataQualityResult` could be populated with `NaN` instead of `None`, causing Pydantic validation errors. This arose from differences in how `NaN`/`NULL` values are handled across PySpark and pandas versions.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-12

### Removed
- Removed use of Pydantic's experimental `MISSING` sentinel for `records_passed` in `DataQualityResult`. Relying on experimental Pydantic internals is fragile and may break across versions; `records_passed` now defaults to `None`.

> **Note:** `1.2.0` has been yanked on PyPI due to this issue. Users should upgrade directly to `1.2.1`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- `DataQualityReport.__add__` and `__len__` support: reports can now be combined with `+`/`+=`, and `len(report)` returns the number of results.
- `records_passed` is now included in the standard rule evaluation output (`DataQualityResult`), enabling weighted pass rate calculations in dashboards (e.g. weighting by `records_evaluated` rather than a simple average of `pass_rate`).
- `filter` parameter for every rule allowing you to only evaluate a rule for records that pass the filter.

### Changed
- Rule classes have been renamed to more descriptive `Values*` names (old names remain importable as aliases for backward compatibility):
  - `UniquenessRule` → `ValuesAreUnique`
  - `CompletenessRule` → `ValuesAreComplete`
  - `AccuracyRule` → `ValuesMatchList`
  - `ConsistencyRule` → `ValuesMatchExpression`
  - `ValidityRegexRule` → `ValuesMatchRegex`
  - `ValidityNumericalRangeRule` → `ValuesMatchNumericalRange`
  - `TimelinessStaticRule` → `ValuesMatchStaticTimeBounds`
  - `TimelinessRelativeRule` → `ValuesMatchRelativeTimeBounds`
- Improved error feedback when YAML-defined regex patterns are malformed, with actionable messages to help users diagnose and fix the issue.

### Removed
- Removed the skeleton Elasticsearch implementation. Because query results are highly dependent on index mappings and cross-column comparisons are awkward, the recommended approach is to use `eland` to sample data from Elasticsearch into a DataFrame and apply rules there.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-23

### Changed
- Extended pandas version support to include pandas 3.0. This required updates to the test suite but does not change runtime behaviour.
